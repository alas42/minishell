//some test cases
echo "hello world" 'this' | wc -l ; ls -l | << grep 'a' >> outfile
awk –f x.awk | sort –u < infile > outfile


//questions
If i have double pipe somwhere || or |& should we show an error?
since we dont have to handle those

char **envs or t_env ?

Chained list and tab of pointers to char for the same env
Why ?
We have to pass a tab of pointers in execve.
But we have to print them in two different ways in env and export builtins

Env -> In alphabetical order BUT without double quotes around the value
Export -> In normal order from envp but the last before NULL will be the terminal
When adding a key=value, add it just before the line from terminal
