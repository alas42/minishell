Chained list and tab of pointers to char for the same env
{
	Why char **envs and t_env ?
	
	We have to pass a tab of pointers in execve.
	But we have to print them in two different ways in env and export builtins

	Env -> In alphabetical order BUT without double quotes around the value
	Export -> In normal order from envp but the last before NULL will be the terminal
	When adding a key=value, add it just before the line from terminal
}
